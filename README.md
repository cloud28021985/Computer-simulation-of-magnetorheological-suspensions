# Computer-simulation-of-magnetorheological-suspensions
The program is an implementation of a computer model of structural transformations in magnetorheological suspensions. The model is based on the numerical solution of a system of ordinary differential equations of motion of magnetic particles in a carrier fluid. The program is designed to calculate the elastic shear properties of concentrated magnetorheological suspensions. This program can be useful for scientific calculations in the field of molecular dynamics. When the program starts, the necessary physical characteristics are calculated and the received data is written to text files. For parallel computing, Message Passing Interface (MPI) technology is used. The results of the calculation performed by the program explain the nonmonotonic dependence of stress vs shear. This maximum of the stress is explained by the destruction of internal structures during large deformation.
